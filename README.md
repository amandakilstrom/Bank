# Bank
The first assignment I did in school was to create a bank that can handle deposits and withdrawals.
You can view the balance of a specific account and see a list of all accounts and their balances.

The program has 5 cases for each menu choice. The first case is to make a deposit and it contains an
if statement that tells the user if the search didn't find one account. It has one if statement that 
checks if the user wrote a negative number.

The second case is to make a whitdrawal. It contains if statements that checks that the user wrote a
positive number and checks if the account has the ammount the user wanna whitdraw.

The third case makes the user search for one account that the user wanna see the balance of.

The fourth case show all accounts balances.

The fifth case exits the program.

The default case gives the user a message if a menuchoice was not written.

The program has one method that tells the user how to back to the main menu. 
It also clears the consol window.
